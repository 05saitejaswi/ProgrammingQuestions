Pranav and Change

Pranav, an enthusiastic kid visited the "Fun Fair 2017" along with his family.
His father wanted him to purchase entry tickets from the counter for his
family members. Being a little kid, he is just learning to understand about 
units of money. Pranav has paid some amount of money for the tickets but he 
wants your help to give him back the change of Rs. N using minimum number of
rupee notes.

Consider a currency system in which there are notes of six denominations, 
namely, Rs. 1, Rs. 2, Rs. 5, Rs. 10, Rs. 50, Rs. 100. If the change given 
to Pranav is Rs. N is input, write a program to compute smallest number 
of notes that will combine to give Rs. N.

Note : Dont use inbuilt loop functions.

Input Format :
First line of the input is an integer N, the change to be given to Pranav.

Output should display the smallest number of notes that will combine to give N.
Refer sample input and output for formatting specifications.
