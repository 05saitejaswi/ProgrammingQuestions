Write a program to delete a node in the singly linked list L.


Note:
The last element from the user should be the first element in the linked list.


Input Format:
The first line of input denotes the list size Ls(n) followed by 
the elements e1, e2, e3, ... en in the list L in the next line.
The last line of input denotes the element e to be deleted.


Output Format :
Displays the list L after deletion.
Note: If element is not present in the list, then just print the list.


Code Constraints:
0  < list size  <= 10^5
0  < e1, e2, ... , en <= 10^8


Sample Testcases : 

Input 1                           Output 1

4                                 3 2 1 
1 2 3 4
4

Input 2                           Output 2
534 56 21 43 77                   77 43 56 534 
21

Black list :
[    ]

Note:

The program will not be evaluated if "Submit Code" is not done atleast once.
Extra spaces and new line charactes in the program will also
result in the testcase failing
