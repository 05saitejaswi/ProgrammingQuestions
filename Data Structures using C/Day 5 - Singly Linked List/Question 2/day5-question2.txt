Given a linked list, write a funciton to reverse.

If a linked list is given as  1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 
and then the output would be  6 -> 5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 


Input Format:
Number of list elements followed by list elements in each line.
(Refer Sample input)


Output Format:
Display the list in both order.
(Refer sample output)


Sample Testcases:

Input 1              Output 1

4                    44  33  22  11  
11                   11  22  33  44  
22
33
44


Note:

The program will not be evaluated if "Submit Code" is not done atleast once.
Extra spaces and new line charactes in the program will also
result in the testcase failing
