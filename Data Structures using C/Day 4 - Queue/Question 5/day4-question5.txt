Kodaikanal is a popular hill station in Tamil Nadu. There is a museum and a 
park for safari riding. There are many passengers and 'n' single-passengers 
cars. Passengers wander around the museum for a a while and then line up at the
park gate to take a ride in a safari car. Note that each passenger is allowed 
for one ride only.

When a car is available, it loads the one passenger it can hold and rides 
the park for a specific amount of time say 'p'. If all the 'n' cars are out 
riding passengers around, then a passenger who wants to ride waits; if a car 
is ready to load but there are no waiting passengers, then the car waits. 
After every 'r' units of time one passenger from the museum gets ready to 
take the safari car ride.

Assume that the park is open for 'k' units of time. Write a program to find 
the status of the passengers after k units of time.


Input format :
First line of input contains the following :
Number of safari cars,
Number of passengers in museum at time zero,
Number of passengers at park gate ready for ride at time zero,
p,
r,
k
separated by space.

The input to this program is the total number of safari cars available 
in the park 'n'. The number of passengers wandering in the museum 'm' and 
the number of passengers 'q' in the park gate ready to take a ride at time
zero. The other inputs are the values of 'p', 'r' and 'k'. Note that there
can be no negative or fractional inputs.

Output format :
Number of cars waiting at the park gate,
Number of passengers completed the park ride,
Number of passengers wandering in the museum,
Number of passengers still waiting to take a ride respectively.
The output parameters should be in the above order with one space.

The output of this program is
the number of cars waiting in the park gate,
the number of passengers who have completed taking one ride in the park,
the number of passengers still waiting at the park gate to take a ride and
the number of passengers still wandering in the museum, respectively,
after 'k' units of time.


Code Constraints:
0 <= n <= 50
0 <= m <= 5000
0 <= q <= 100
1 <= p <= 100
1 <= r <= 100
r <= k <= 100000

Sample testcases

Input 1                     Output 1
3 20 5 3 1 10               0 9 10 3

The program will not be evaluated if "Submit Code" is not done atleast once.
Extra spaces and new line charactes in the program will also
result in the testcase failing
