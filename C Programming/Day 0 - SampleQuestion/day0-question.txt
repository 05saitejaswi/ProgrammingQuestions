Dimension of a photo is denoted as W x H, where :
    W - Width of the photo
    H - Height of the photo

When any photo is uploaded, following events may occur:
    1. If any one of the width or height is less than L, the user
       is prompted to upload another one. Print "CHANGE" in this case.
    2. If width and height, both are large enough, and,
        (a) if the photo is already squared and size is L x L,
            then it is accepted. Print "ACCEPTED" in this case.
        (b) else user is prompted to crop it. 
            Print "CROP" in this case.

Input Format:
The input contains L and followed by two space-separated integers
W and H in next line.

Output Format:
Print approprieate text for each photo in a new line.
The output should be in Uppercase.

Code constraints:
    1 <= L <= 1000
    1 <= W <= 1000
    1 <= H <= 1000

Sample testcases:

Input 1             Output 1
180                 ACCEPTED
180 180

Input 2             Output 2
150                 CROP
640 540

Input 3             Output 3
175                 CHANGE
160 180

Note:

The program will not be evaluated if "Submit Code" is not done atleast once.
Extra spaces and new line charactes in the program will also
result in the testcase failing
