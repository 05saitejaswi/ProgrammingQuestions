Write a program to check an user ID is valid or not. Assume the user ID is valid only if it
follows rules like,
1. One uppercase (A-Z) and one lowercase (a-z) English letters
2. Digits (0-9)
3. Special characters allowed is . (dot) provided that it is not the first or last character
   and it will not come one after the other(double dots like..)

Input format
User Id as String

Output format
Valid or Invalid along with user Id as shown in sample Output

Sample testcases
Input 1                    Output 1
Anu.123                    Anu.123 is Valid      

Input 2                    Output 2
.anu                       .anu is Invalid

Note:
The program will not be evaluated if "Submit Code" is not done atleast once
Extra spaces and new line characters in the program Output will also result in the testcase failing
